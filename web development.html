    <h1>Introduction about Web development</h1>
    <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.

        Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).
        
        The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.
        
        What Exactly is Web Development?
        
        Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction and programming of websites and apps.
        
        Think of all the web pages you have used over the years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are performing and the platforms they are working on.
        
        Web Development vs. Web Design
        Though there is overlap, there are also key differences between web development and web design. Let’s take a closer look:
        
        Web Designers:
        
        Create everything a user sees on a website or software product, including all visual, color, typography, and usability elements
        Work directly with a client to create designs or work as part of a team to develop client vision
        May need knowledge of a programming language or some coding skills, or at least some level of familiarity with widely used languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript
        Create wireframes and prototypes to test design ideas, offer input on design logos, branding, company style guides
        Web Developers:
        
        Write the code that makes a website function, whether they work on the front end or back end (server-side)
        Create or implement designs demanded by a client or created by a design team
        Need expert-level knowledge of a variety of programming languages, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS, PHP, and JavaScript but also extending to other languages (Ruby, C/C++, Python), frameworks, and libraries
        Rarely create mockups, select typography, or pick color palettes</p>
